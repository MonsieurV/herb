* &env macro
  In order to evaluate things in context, you first need to garner the bindings
  in the current context. Fortunately, Clojure macros provide an implicit
  argument ~&env~ that’s a map of the local bindings available at macro-expansion
  time. You can extract from ~&env~ the values associated with the bindings and
  zip them up with their names into a map for the local context, as shown next.

  #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (defmacro local-context []
      (let [symbols (keys &env)] ; Use the special &env
        (zipmap (map (fn [sym] `(quote ~sym)) ; Zip up the local names with local values
                     symbols)
                symbols)))
  #+END_SRC

  One interesting point is the use of the ~&env~ symbol. This special symbol holds
  the value of the bindings available to the macro in which it occurs. The
  bindings are of a special type that is opaque to your direct inspection, but by
  putting them into the return map you can build a Clojure data structure from
  them for direct use and manipulation. Observe ~local-context~ in action:

  #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (local-context)
    ;=> {}

    (let [a 1, b 2, c 3]
      (let [b 200]
        (local-context)))
    ;=> {a 1, b 200, c 3}
  #+END_SRC

  The ~local-context~ macro provides a map to the most immediate lexical bindings,
  which is what you want.

  CLOSED: [2018-10-03 Wed 19:09]
  It thows the defgroup error with a blank for component. Consider improving error message
* TODO Add note about setting debug flag to false on prod builds

  I know css supports a larger range of classname chars but I think passing
  through hiccup or reagent they get sanitized

 Specifically that the compose-data-string still works with new regexp
